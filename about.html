        <h1>What is SociAble?</h1>
        <p><strong>Not just a chatbot.</strong> SociAble is a social practice sandbox for kids: pick a scenario (grocery store, playground, classroom), talk to a character, and see how your words affect their mood. If you're kind, they smile. If you're rude, they get hurt—so you learn cause and effect in a safe space. The "vibe check" gently flags mean language and suggests rephrasing instead of blocking. <strong>Goal:</strong> practice real social moments with real emotional feedback.</p>
        <p><strong>How can SociAble help an autistic child?</strong> Many autistic children find social situations unpredictable and overwhelming. SociAble is designed to support practice in ways that can reduce that stress: <strong>predictable scenarios</strong> (same places, clear goals) so there's less surprise; <strong>visual feedback</strong> (the character's face and mood) so the link between words and feelings is clear; <strong>no real-world consequences</strong>—mistakes only affect the character in the sandbox, so it's safe to try and rephrase; <strong>gentle "try again"</strong> instead of harsh correction when language is unkind; and <strong>clear goals per scenario</strong> so practice has structure. It's a tool to rehearse social moments at the child's pace, and works well alongside a parent, caregiver, or educator.</p>
